# Memory Optimization Summary

## Problem
The application was consuming excessive memory (2338MB) and crashing with JavaScript heap out of memory errors.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Duplicate AWS SDKs**: Both AWS SDK v2 and v3 were installed
2. **Heavy dependencies**: googleapis package (150MB+) and duplicate AWS SDKs
3. **Excessive heap allocation**: Node.js was configured with 4GB heap size
4. **No memory monitoring**: No visibility into memory leaks or usage patterns

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Dependency Cleanup
- ✅ Removed AWS SDK v2 (`aws-sdk`)
- ✅ Removed googleapis package (not actively used)
- ✅ Removed unused type definitions (`@types/aws-sdk`)
- **Result**: Reduced dependency footprint by ~200-300MB

### 2. Node.js Memory Configuration
- ✅ Reduced `--max-old-space-size` from 4096MB to 512MB
- ✅ Added `--optimize-for-size` flag for better memory efficiency
- ✅ Added `--gc-interval=100` for more frequent garbage collection
- ✅ Added `--expose-gc` to enable manual garbage collection

### 3. Enhanced Memory Monitoring
- ✅ Created advanced memory monitoring utility with:
  - Memory leak detection
  - Request-level memory tracking
  - Periodic memory cleanup
  - Memory usage alerts
  - Historical memory snapshots

### 4. Code Optimizations
- ✅ Implemented lazy loading for AWS SDK v3 clients
- ✅ Added memory optimization middleware
- ✅ Added periodic memory cleanup (every 5 minutes)
- ✅ Added memory report endpoint for debugging

### 5. Request Optimizations
- ✅ Reduced body parser limits to 5MB
- ✅ Added request timeout middleware (30 seconds)
- ✅ Optimized MongoDB connection pool (reduced to 5 connections)

## Configuration Files Updated

### package.json
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node --max-old-space-size=512 --optimize-for-size dist/server.js",
    "clean": "rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install"
  }
}
```

### nodemon.json
```json
{
  "exec": "node --max-old-space-size=512 --optimize-for-size --gc-interval=100 --expose-gc -r ts-node/register src/server.ts"
}
```

## New Features Added

### 1. Memory Report Endpoint
- **URL**: `GET /api/memory-report` (development only)
- **Purpose**: View current memory usage and historical trends

### 2. Health Check with Memory Stats
- **URL**: `GET /health`
- **Includes**: Heap usage, RSS, external memory

### 3. Memory Headers in Responses
- `X-Memory-Used`: Current memory usage
- `X-Memory-Delta`: Memory change during request

## Expected Results
- Memory usage should stay under 512MB during normal operation
- Automatic garbage collection when memory exceeds 300MB
- Memory leak detection and alerts
- Better visibility into memory consumption patterns

## Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check health with memory stats
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# View memory report (development only)
curl http://localhost:5000/api/memory-report

# Clean and reinstall dependencies
npm run clean
```

## Next Steps
1. Monitor memory usage over time
2. Identify and fix any remaining memory leaks
3. Consider implementing request pooling for external APIs
4. Add memory usage metrics to application monitoring
